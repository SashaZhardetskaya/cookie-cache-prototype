<p>* we can't lead user to 'cache / cookies / history / downloads' page, because it doesn't exist</p>

<h3>--- cookies By Domain ---</h3>

<ol class="js-cookies-show-third-parties-list"></ol>
<button class="js-cookies-clear-third-parties-btn">Clear all cookies (+3d party and more) set by current tab</button>
<p>* means that we'll try to remove cookies for all outgoing urls (even if it's not set a cookie on current site). But we still unable to clear cookies set from js (small %). E.g. we clear cookies on website that use google capture => user can't automatically authorize to google</p>

<h3>--- Caches ---</h3>
<button class="js-caches-clear-current-site-btn">Remove caches from current tab</button>
<p>* technically we remove more cache, not only cached responses on requests from current tab.
    E.g. on facebook we make request to 'https://google.com/images/sa31232j', so we remove all cached files from google.com from all tab</p>
<button class="js-caches-clear-all-btn">Remove ALL caches</button>
<button class="js-caches-clear-past-ten-minutes-btn">Remove all caches for past 10 minutes</button>
<p>* we can NOT show caches by domain. We can only show requests, which response was cached earlier
    (so we will not show any cache in first site load).
    We can NOT show size or any other data.
</p>
<p>* ??? we may be able to read caches from file system. it's located: C:\Users\zhara\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\ {'Code Cache' and 'Cache' directories} </p>

<button class="js-downloads-clear-all-btn">Clear ALL downloads</button>
<button class="js-downloads-clear-past-ten-minutes-btn">Clear all downloads for past 10 minutes</button>
<p>* we don't know on what site user was when he downloaded file. We can show sizes of the files, and it's how many files was downloaded/removed</p>
<p>* Firefox has two different entities which contains information about downloaded files. So even when we delete it from 'downloads' list (in firefox settings) it still present at 'downloads history'</p>

<p>* we can also Get an information about pages that the user has visited often and recently: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/topSites/get</p>
